# 'Tetris style' game

Aim of the game is to fit the given blocks in the grid. If you fill a line
that line clears and you receive points. As the game progresses the timer to
place a piece shortens.

*Multiplayer was supported but the server is no longer running...*

`mvn package` creates the uber jar (executable jar file with all the dependencies)
`java -jar game.jar` runs the project
